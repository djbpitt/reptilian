is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases . if selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety , and breeding from it , the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice ; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction , during successive generations , of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye — differences which i for one have vainly attempted to appreciate . not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder . if gifted with these qualities , and he studies his subject for years , and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance , he will succeed , and may make great improvements ; if he wants any of these qualities , he will assuredly fail . few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon - fancier . the same principles are followed by

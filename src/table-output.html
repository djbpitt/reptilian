long - haired and coarse - haired animals are apt to have , as is asserted , long or many horns ; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes ; pigeons with short beaks have small feet , and those with long beaks large feet . hence , if man goes on selecting , and thus augmenting , any peculiarity , he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure , owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth . the result of the various , quite unknown , or dimly seen laws of variation is infinitely complex and diversified . it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants , as on the hyacinth , potato , even the dahlia , & c .; and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub - varieties differ slightly from each other . the whole organisation seems to have become plastic , and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type . any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us . but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure , both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance , is endless . dr . prosper lucas ' s treatise , in two large volumes , is the fullest and the best on this subject . no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance : like produces like is his fundamental belief : doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone . when a deviation appears not unfrequently , and we see it in the father and child , we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same original cause acting on both ; but when amongst individuals , apparently exposed to the same conditions , any very rare deviation , due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances , appears in the parent — say , once amongst several million individuals — and it reappears in the child , the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance . every one must have heard of cases of albinism , prickly skin , hairy bodies , & c ., appearing in several members of the same family . if strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited , less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable . perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject , would be , to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule , and non - inheritance as the anomaly . the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown ; no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species , and in individuals of different species , is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so ; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or other much more remote ancestor ; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes , or to one sex alone , more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex . it is a fact of some little importance to us , that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either exclusively , or in a much greater degree , to males alone . a much more important rule , which i think may be trusted , is that , at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears , it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age , though sometimes earlier . in many cases this could not be otherwise : thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature ; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage . but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension , and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age , yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent . i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology . these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity , and not to its primary cause , which may have acted on the ovules or male element ; in nearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a short - horned cow by a long - horned bull , the greater length of horn , though appearing late in life , is clearly due to the male element . having alluded to the subject of reversion , i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists — namely , that our domestic varieties , when run wild , gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks . hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature . i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made . there would be great difficulty in proving its truth : we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly - marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state . in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was , and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued . it would be quite necessary , in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing , that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home . nevertheless , as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms , it seems to me not improbable , that if we could succeed in naturalising , or were to cultivate , during many generations , the several races , for instance , of the cabbage , in very poor soil ( in which case , however , some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil ), that they would to a large extent , or even wholly , revert to the wild aboriginal stock . whether or not the experiment would succeed , is not of great importance for our line of argument ; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed . if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion , — that is , to lose their acquired characters , whilst kept under unchanged conditions , and whilst kept in a considerable body , so that free intercrossing might check , by blending together , any slight deviations of structure , in such case , i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species . but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view : to assert that we could not breed our cart and race - horses , long and short - horned cattle , and poultry of various breeds , and esculent vegetables , for an almost infinite number of generations , would be opposed to all experience . i may add , that when under nature the conditions of life do change , variations and reversions of character probably do occur ; but natural selection , as will hereafter be explained , will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved . when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants , and compare them with species closely allied together , we generally perceive in each domestic race , as already remarked , less uniformity of character than in true species . domestic races of the same species , also , often have a somewhat monstrous character ; by which i mean , that , although differing from each other , and from the other species of the same genus , in several trifling respects , they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part , both when compared one with another , and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied . with these exceptions ( and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed , — a subject hereafter to be discussed ), domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as , only in most cases in a lesser degree than , do closely - allied species of the same genus in a state of nature . i think this must be admitted , when we find that there are hardly any domestic races , either amongst animals or plants , which have not been ranked by some competent judges as mere varieties , and by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species . if any marked distinction existed between domestic races and species , this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur . it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value . i think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct ; but naturalists differ most widely in determining what characters are of generic value ; all such valuations being at present empirical . moreover , on the view of the origin of genera which i shall presently give , we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions . when we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species , we are soon involved in doubt , from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent - species . this point , if it could be cleared up , would be interesting ; if , for instance , it could be shown that the grey - hound , bloodhound , terrier , spaniel , and bull - dog , which we all know propagate their kind so truly , were the offspring of any single species , then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied and natural species — for instance , of the many foxes — inhabiting different quarters of the world . i do not believe , as we shall presently see , that all our dogs have descended from any one wild species ; but , in the case of some other domestic races , there is presumptive , or even strong , evidence in favour of this view . it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary , and likewise to withstand diverse climates . i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions ; but how could a savage possibly know , when he first tamed an animal , whether it would vary in succeeding generations , and whether it would endure other climates ? has the little variability of the ass or guinea - fowl , or the small power of endurance of warmth by the rein - deer , or of cold by the common camel , prevented their domestication ? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants , equal in number to our domesticated productions , and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries , were taken from a state of nature , and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication , they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied . in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants , i do not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion , whether they have descended from one or several species . the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is , that we find in the most ancient records , more especially on the monuments of egypt , much diversity in the breeds ; and that some of the breeds closely resemble , perhaps are identical with , those still existing . even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case , what does it show , but that some of our breeds originated there , four or five thousand years ago ? but mr . horner ' s researches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago ; and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods , savages , like those of tierra del fuego or australia , who possess a semi - domestic dog , may not have existed in egypt ? the whole subject must , i think , remain vague ; neverthelsss , i may , without here entering on any details , state that , from geographical and other considerations , i think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species . in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion . i should think , from facts communicated to me by mr . blyth , on the habits , voice , and constitution , & c ., of the humped indian cattle , that these had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle ; and several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent . with respect to horses , from reasons which i cannot give here , i am doubtfully inclined to believe , in opposition to several authors , that all the races have descended from one wild stock . mr . blyth , whose opinion , from his large and varied stores of knowledge , i should value more than that of almost any one , thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild indian fowl ( gallus bankiva ). in regard to ducks and rabbits , the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure , i do not doubt that they all have descended from the common wild duck and rabbit . the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks , has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors . they believe that every race which breeds true , let the distinctive characters be ever so slight , has had its wild prototype . at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle , as many sheep , and several goats in europe alone , and several even within great britain . one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it ! when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal , and france but few distinct from those of germany and conversely , and so with hungary , spain , & c ., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle , sheep , & c ., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe ; for whence could they have been derived , as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent - stocks ? so it is in india . even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world , which i fully admit have probably descended from several wild species , i cannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation . who can believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound , the bloodhound , the bull - dog , or blenheim spaniel , & c . — so unlike all wild canidæ — ever existed freely in a state of nature ? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species ; but by crossing we can get only forms in some degree intermediate between their parents ; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process , we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms , as the italian greyhound , bloodhound , bull - dog , & c ., in the wild state . moreover , the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated . there can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses , if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels , which present any desired character ; but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or speceies , i can hardly believe . sir j . sebright expressly experimentised for this object , and failed . the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes ( as i have found with pigeons ) extremely uniform , and everything seems simple enough ; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations , hardly two of them will be alike , and then the extreme difficulty , or rather utter hopelessness , of the task becomes apparent . certainly , a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and long - continued selection ; nor can i find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed . on the breeds of the domestic pigeon .— believing that it is always best to study some special group , i have , after deliberation , taken up domestic pigeons . i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain , and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world , more especially by the hon . w . elliot from india , and by the hon . c . murray from persia . many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons , and some of them are very important , as being of considerable antiquity . i have associated with several eminent fanciers , and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs . the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing . compare the english carrier and the short - faced tumbler , and see the wonderful difference in their beaks , entailing corresponding differences in their skulls . the carrier , more especially the male bird , is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head , and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids , very large external orifices to the nostrils , and a wide gape of mouth . the short - faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch ; and the common tumbler has the singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock , and tumbling in the air head over heels . the runt is a bird of great size , with long , massive beak and large feet ; some of the sub - breeds of runts have very long necks , others very long wings and tails , others singularly short tails . the barb is allied to the carrier , but , instead of a very long beak , has a very short and very broad one . the pouter has a much elongated body , wings , and legs ; and its enormously developed crop , which it glories in inflating , may well excite astonishment and even laughter . the turbit has a very short and conical beak , with a line of reversed feathers down the breast ; and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the œsophagus . the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood , and it has , proportionally to its size , much elongated wing and tail feathers . the trumpeter and laugher , as their names express , utter a very different coo from the other breeds . the fantail has thirty or even forty tail - feathers , instead of twelve or fourteen , the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family ; and these feathers are kept expanded , and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch ; the oil - gland is quite aborted . several other less distinct breeds might have been specified . in the skeletons of the several breeds , the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously . the shape , as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw , varies in a highly remarkable manner . the number of the caudal and sacral vertebræ vary ; as does the number of the ribs , together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes . the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable ; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula . the proportional width of the gape of mouth , the proportional length of the eyelids , of the orifice of the nostrils , of the tongue ( not always in strict correlation with the length of beak ), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the œsophagus ; the development and abortion of the oil - gland ; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers ; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body ; the relative length of leg and of the feet ; the number of scutellæ on the toes , the development of skin between the toes , are all points of structure which are variable . the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies , as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched . the shape and size of the eggs vary . the manner of flight differs remarkably ; as does in some breeds the voice and disposition . lastly , in certain breeds , the males and females have come to differ to a slight degree from each other . altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen , which if shown to an ornithologist , and he were told that they were wild birds , would certainly , i think , be ranked by him as well - defined species . moreover , i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the english carrier , the short - faced tumbler , the runt , the barb , pouter , and fantail in the same genus ; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly - inherited sub - breeds , or species as he might have called them , could be shown him . great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons , i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct , namely , that all have descended from the rock - pigeon ( columba livia ), including under this term several geographical races or sub - species , which differ from each other in the most trifling respects . as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases , i will here briefly give them . if the several breeds are not varieties , and have not proceeded from the rock - pigeon , they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks ; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number : how , for instance , could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent - stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop ? the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock - pigeons , that is , not breeding or willingly perching on trees . but besides c . livia , with its geographical sub - species , only two or three other species of rock - pigeons are known ; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds . hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated , and yet be unknown to ornithologists ; and this , considering their size , habits , and remarkable characters , seems very improbable ; or they must have become extinct in the wild state . but birds breeding on precipices , and good fliers , are unlikely to be exterminated ; and the common rock - pigeon , which has the same habits with the domestic breeds , has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets , or on the shores of the mediterranean . hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock - pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption . moreover , the several above - named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world , and , therefore , some of them must have been carried back again into their native country ; but not one has ever become wild or feral , though the dovecot - pigeon , which is the rock - pigeon in a very slightly altered state , has become feral in several places . again , all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication ; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons , it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half - civilized man , as to be quite prolific under confinement . an argument , as it seems to me , of great weight , and applicable in several other cases , is , that the above - specified breeds , though agreeing generally in constitution , habits , voice , colouring , and in most parts of their structure , with the wild rock - pigeon , yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure : we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of columbidæ for a beak like that of the english carrier , or that of the short - faced tumbler , or barb ; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin ; for a crop like that of the pouter ; for tail - feathers like those of the fantail . hence it must be assumed not only that half - civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species , but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species ; and further , that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown . so many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree . some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration . the rock - pigeon is of a slaty - blue , and has a white rump ( the indian sub - species , c . intermedia of strickland , having it bluish ); the tail has a terminal dark bar , with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white ; the wings have two black bars ; some semi - domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have , besides the two black bars , the wings chequered with black . these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family . now , in every one of the domestic breeds , taking thoroughly well - bred birds , all the above marks , even to the white edging of the outer tail - feathers , sometimes concur perfectly developed . moreover , when two birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed , neither of which is blue or has any of the above - specified marks , the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters ; for instance , i crossed some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs , and they produced mottled brown and black birds ; these i again crossed together ,</td><td style="border: 1px black solid; border-collapse: collapse;">by certain vegetable poisons . hairless dogs have imperfect teeth : long - haired and coarse - haired animals are apt to have , as is asserted , long or many horns ; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes ; pigeons with short beaks have small feet , and those with long beaks large feet . hence , if man goes on selecting , and thus augmenting , any peculiarity , he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure , owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth . the result of the various , quite unknown , or dimly seen laws of variation is infinitely complex and diversified . it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants , as on the hyacinth , potato , even the dahlia , & c .; and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub - varieties differ slightly from each other . the whole organisation seems to have become plastic , and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type . any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us . but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure , both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance , is endless . dr . prosper lucas ' s treatise , in two large volumes , is the fullest and the best on this subject . no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance : like produces like is his fundamental belief : doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone . when any deviation of structure often appears , and we see it in the father and child , we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both ; but when amongst individuals , apparently exposed to the same conditions , any very rare deviation , due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances , appears in the parent — say , once amongst several million individuals — and it reappears in the child , the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance . every one must have heard of cases of albinism , prickly skin , hairy bodies , & c ., appearing in several members of the same family . if strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited , less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable . perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject , would be , to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule , and non - inheritance as the anomaly . the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown ; no one can say why a peculiarity in different individuals of the same species , or in individuals of different species , is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so ; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or other more remote ancestor ; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes , or to one sex alone , more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex . it is a fact of some little importance to us , that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either exclusively , or in a much greater degree , to males alone . a much more important rule , which i think may be trusted , is that , at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears , it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age , though sometimes earlier . in many cases this could not be otherwise : thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature ; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage . but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension , and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age , yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent . i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology . these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity , and not to its primary cause , which may have acted on the ovules or male element ; in nearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a short - horned cow by a long - horned bull , the greater length of horn , though appearing late in life , is clearly due to the male element . having alluded to the subject of reversion , i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists — namely , that our domestic varieties , when run wild , gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks . hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature . i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made . there would be great difficulty in proving its truth : we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly - marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state . in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was , and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued . it would be quite necessary , in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing , that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home . nevertheless , as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms , it seems to me not improbable , that if we could succeed in naturalising , or were to cultivate , during many generations , the several races , for instance , of the cabbage , in very poor soil ( in which case , however , some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil ), that they would to a large extent , or even wholly , revert to the wild aboriginal stock . whether or not the experiment would succeed , is not of great importance for our line of argument ; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed . if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion , — that is , to lose their acquired characters , whilst kept under the same conditions , and whilst kept in a considerable body , so that free intercrossing might check , by blending together , any slight deviations in their structure , in such case , i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species . but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view : to assert that we could not breed our cart and race - horses , long and short - horned cattle , and poultry of various breeds , and esculent vegetables , for an almost infinite number of generations , would be opposed to all experience . i may add , that when under nature the conditions of life do change , variations and reversions of character probably do occur ; but natural selection , as will hereafter be explained , will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved . when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants , and compare them with closely allied species , we generally perceive in each domestic race , as already remarked , less uniformity of character than in true species . domestic races of the same species , also , often have a somewhat monstrous character ; by which i mean , that , although differing from each other , and from other species of the same genus , in several trifling respects , they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part , both when compared one with another , and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied . with these exceptions ( and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed , — a subject hereafter to be discussed ), domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as , only in most cases in a lesser degree than , do closely - allied species of the same genus in a state of nature . i think this must be admitted , when we find that there are hardly any domestic races , either amongst animals or plants , which have not been ranked by competent judges as mere varieties , and by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species . if any marked distinction existed between domestic races and species , this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur . it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value . i think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct ; but naturalists differ widely in determining what characters are of generic value ; all such valuations being at present empirical . moreover , on the view of the origin of genera which i shall presently give , we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions . when we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species , we are soon involved in doubt , from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parentspecies . this point , if it could be cleared up , would be interesting ; if , for instance , it could be shown that the greyhound , bloodhound , terrier , spaniel , and bull - dog , which we all know propagate their kind so truly , were the offspring of any single species , then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied natural species — for instance , of the many foxes — inhabiting different quarters of the world . i do not believe , as we shall presently see , that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication ; i believe that some small part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species . in the case of some other domesticated species , there is presumptive , or even strong evidence , that all the breeds have descended from a single wild stock . it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary , and likewise to withstand diverse climates . i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions ; but how could a savage possibly know , when he first tamed an animal , whether it would vary in succeeding generations , and whether it would endure other climates ? has the little variability of the ass or guinea - fowl , or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer , or of cold by the common camel , prevented their domestication ? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants , equal in number to our domesticated productions , and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries , were taken from a state of nature , and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication , they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied . in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants , i do not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion , whether they have descended from one or several wild species . the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is , that we find in the most ancient records , more especially on the monuments of egypt , much diversity in the breeds ; and that some of the breeds closely resemble , perhaps are identical with , those still existing . even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case , what does it show , but that some of our breeds originated there , four or five thousand years ago ? but mr . horner ' s researches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago ; and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods , savages , like those of tierra del fuego or australia , who possess a semi - domestic dog , may not have existed in egypt ? the whole subject must , i think , remain vague ; nevertheless , i may , without here entering on any details , state that , from geographical and other considerations , i think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species . knowing , as we do , that savages are very fond of taming animals , it seems to me unlikely , in the case of the dog - genus , which is distributed in a wild state throughout the world , that since man first appeared one single species alone should have been domesticated . in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion . i should think , from facts communicated to me by mr . blyth , on the habits , voice , and constitution , & c ., of the humped indian cattle , that these had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle ; and several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent . with respect to horses , from reasons which i cannot give here , i am doubtfully inclined to believe , in opposition to several authors , that all the races have descended from one wild stock . mr . blyth , whose opinion , from his large and varied stores of knowledge , i should value more than that of almost any one , thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild indian fowl ( gallus bankiva ). in regard to ducks and rabbits , the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure , i do not doubt that they have all descended from the common wild duck and rabbit . the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks , has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors . they believe that every race which breeds true , let the distinctive characters be ever so slight , has had its wild prototype . at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle , as many sheep , and several goats in europe alone , and several even within great britain . one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it ! when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal , and france but few distinct from those of germany and conversely , and so with hungary , spain , & c ., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle , sheep , & c ., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe ; for whence could they have been derived , as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent - stocks ? so it is in india . even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world , which i fully admit have probably descended from several wild species , i cannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation . who can believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound , the bloodhound , the bull - dog , or blenheim spaniel , & c . — so unlike all wild canidæ — ever existed freely in a state of nature ? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species ; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents ; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process , we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms , as the italian greyhound , bloodhound , bull - dog , & c ., in the wild state . moreover , the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated . there can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses , if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels , which present any desired character ; but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species , i can hardly believe . sir j . sebright expressly experimentised for this object , and failed . the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes ( as i have found with pigeons ) extremely uniform , and everything seems simple enough ; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations , hardly two of them will be alike , and then the extreme difficulty , or rather utter hopelessness , of the task becomes apparent . certainly , a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and long - continued selection ; nor can i find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed . on the breeds of the domestic pigeon .— believing that it is always best to study some special group , i have , after deliberation , taken up domestic pigeons . i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain , and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world , more especially by the hon . w . elliot from india , and by the hon . c . murray from persia . many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons , and some of them are very important , as being of con - siderable antiquity . i have associated with several eminent fanciers , and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs . the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing . compare the english carrier and the short - faced tumbler , and see the wonderful difference in their beaks , entailing corresponding differences in their skulls . the carrier , more especially the male bird , is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head , and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids , very large external orifices to the nostrils , and a wide gape of mouth . the short - faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch ; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock , and tumbling in the air head over heels . the runt is a bird of great size , with long , massive beak and large feet ; some of the sub - breeds of runts have very long necks , others very long wings and tails , others singularly short tails . the barb is allied to the carrier , but , instead of a very long beak , has a very short and very broad one . the pouter has a much elongated body , wings , and legs ; and its enormously developed crop , which it glories in inflating , may well excite astonishment and even laughter . the turbit has a very short and conical beak , with a line of reversed feathers down the breast ; and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the œsophagus . the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood , and it has , proportionally to its size , much elongated wing and tail feathers . the trumpeter and laugher , as their names express , utter a very different coo from the other breeds . the fantail has thirty or even forty tail feathers , instead of twelve or fourteen , the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family ; and these feathers are kept expanded , and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch ; the oil - gland is quite aborted . several other less distinct breeds might be specified . in the skeletons of the several breeds , the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously . the shape , as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw , varies in a highly remarkable manner . the number of the caudal and sacral vertebræ vary ; as does the number of the ribs , together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes . the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable ; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula . the proportional width of the gape of mouth , the proportional length of the eyelids , of the orifice of the nostrils , of the tongue ( not always in strict correlation with the length of beak ), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the œsophagus ; the development and abortion of the oil - gland ; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers ; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body ; the relative length of leg and of the feet ; the number of scutellæ on the toes , the development of skin between the toes , are all points of structure which are variable . the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies , as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched . the shape and size of the eggs vary . the manner of flight differs remarkably ; as does in some breeds the voice and disposition . lastly , in certain breeds , the males and females have come to differ to a slight degree from each other . altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen , which if shown to an ornithologist , and he were told that they were wild birds , would certainly , i think , be ranked by him as well - defined species . moreover , i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the english carrier , the short - faced tumbler , the runt , the barb , pouter , and fantail in the same genus ; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly - inherited sub - breeds , or species as he might have called them , could be shown him . great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons , i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct , namely , that all have descended from the rock - pigeon ( columba livia ), including under this term several geographical races or sub - species , which differ from each other in the most trifling respects . as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases , i will here briefly give them . if the several breeds are not varieties , and have not proceeded from the rock - pigeon , they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks ; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number : how , for instance , could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent - stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop ? the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock - pigeons , that is , not breeding or willingly perching on trees . but besides c . livia , with its geographical sub - species , only two or three other species of rock - pigeons are known ; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds . hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated , and yet be unknown to ornithologists ; and this , considering their size , habits , and remarkable characters , seems very improbable ; or they must have become extinct in the wild state . but birds breeding on precipices , and good fliers , are unlikely to be exterminated ; and the common rock - pigeon , which has the same habits with the domestic breeds , has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets , or on the shores of the mediterranean . hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock - pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption . moreover , the several above - named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world , and , therefore , some of them must have been carried back again into their native country ; but not one has ever become wild or feral , though the dovecot - pigeon , which is the rock - pigeon in a very slightly altered state , has become feral in several places . again , all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication ; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons , it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half - civilized man , as to be quite prolific under confinement . an argument , as it seems to me , of great weight , and applicable in several other cases , is , that the above - specified breeds , though agreeing generally in constitution , habits , voice , colouring , and in most parts of their structure , with the wild rock - pigeon , yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure ; we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of columbidæ for a beak like that of the english carrier , or that of the short - faced tumbler , or barb ; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin ; for a crop like that of the pouter ; for tail - feathers like those of the fantail . hence it must be assumed not only that half - civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species , but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species ; and further , that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown . so many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree . some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration . the rock - pigeon is of a slaty - blue , and has a white rump ( the indian sub - species , c . intermedia of strickland , having it bluish );

in nearly the same manner as in the offspring from a short - horned cow by a long - horned bull , the greater length of horn , though appearing late in life , is clearly due to the male element . having alluded to the subject of reversion , i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists — namely , that our domestic varieties , when run wild , gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks . hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature . i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made . there would be great difficulty in proving its truth : we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly - marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state . in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was , and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued . it would be quite necessary , in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing , that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home . nevertheless , as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms , it seems to me not improbable , that if we could succeed in naturalising , or were to cultivate , during many generations , the several races , for instance , of the cabbage , in very poor soil ( in which case , however , some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil ), that they would to a large extent , or even wholly , revert to the wild aboriginal stock . whether or not the experiment would succeed , is not of great importance for our line of argument ; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed . if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion , — that is , to lose their acquired characters , whilst kept under the same conditions , and whilst kept in a considerable body , so that free intercrossing might check , by blending together , any slight deviations in their structure , in such case , i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species . but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view : to assert that we could not breed our cart and race - horses , long and short - horned cattle , and poultry of various breeds , and esculent vegetables , for an almost infinite number of generations , would be opposed to all experience . i may add , that when under nature the conditions of life do change , variations and reversions of character probably do occur ;

if , for instance , it could be shown that the greyhound , bloodhound , terrier , spaniel , and bull - dog , which we all know propagate their kind so truly , were the offspring of any single species , then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied natural species — for instance , of the many foxes — inhabiting different quarters of the world . i do not believe , as we shall presently see , that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication ; i believe that some small part of the difference is due to their having descended from distinct species . in the case of some other domesticated species , there is presumptive , or even strong evidence , that all the breeds have descended from a single wild stock . it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary , and likewise to withstand diverse climates . i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions ; but how could a savage possibly know , when he first tamed an animal , whether it would vary in succeeding generations , and whether it would endure other climates ? has the little variability of the ass or guinea - fowl , or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer , or of cold by the common camel prevented their domestication ? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants , equal in number to our domesticated productions , and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries , were taken from a state of nature , and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication , they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied . in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants , it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion , whether they have descended from one or several wild species . the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is , that we find in the most ancient records , more especially on the monuments of egypt , much diversity in the breeds ; and that some of the breeds closely resemble , perhaps are identical with , those still existing . even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case , what does it show , but that some of our breeds originated there , four or five thousand years ago ? since the recent discoveries of flint tools or celts in the superficial deposits of france and england , few geologists will doubt that man , in a sufficiently civilized state to have manufactured weapons , existed at a period extremely remote as measured by years ; and we know that at the present day there is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the dog . the origin of most of our domestic animals will probably for ever remain vague . but i may here state , that looking to the domestic dogs of the whole world , i have , after a laborious collection of all known facts , come to the conclusion that several wild species of canidæ have been tamed , and that their blood , more or less mingled , flows in the veins of our many domestic breeds . in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion . from facts communicated to me by mr . blyth , on the habits , voice , and constitution , & c ., of the humped indian cattle , it is probable that these descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle ; and several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent . with respect to horses , from reasons which i cannot here give , i am with much doubt inclined to believe , in opposition to several authors , that all the races have descended from one wild stock . mr . blyth , whose opinion , from his large and varied stores of knowledge , i should value more than that of almost any one , thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild indian fowl ( gallus bankiva ). in regard to ducks and rabbits , the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure , the evidence preponderates in favour of their having all descended from the common wild duck and rabbit . the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks , has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors . they believe that every race which breeds true , let the distinctive characters be ever so slight , has had its wild prototype . at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle , as many sheep , and several goats in europe alone , and several even within great britain . one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it ! when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal , and france but few distinct from those of germany and conversely , and so with hungary , spain , & c ., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle , sheep , & c ., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe ; for whence could they have been derived , as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent - stocks ? so it is in india . even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world , which i admit to have descended from several wild species , it cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation ; for who will believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound , the bloodhound , the bull - dog , pug - dog , or blenheim spaniel , & c . — so unlike all wild canidæ — ever existed freely in a state of nature ? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species ; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents ; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process , we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms , as the italian greyhound , bloodhound , bull - dog , & c ., in the wild state . moreover , the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated . many cases are on record , showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses , if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels which present any desired character ; but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species , i can hardly believe . sir j . sebright expressly experimented for this object , and failed . the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes ( as i have found with pigeons ) extremely uniform , and everything seems simple enough ; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations , hardly two of them will be alike ; and then the extreme difficulty , or rather utter hopelessness , of the task becomes apparent . cer - tainly , a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and long - continued selection ; nor can i find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed . on the breeds of the domestic pigeon .— believing that it is always best to study some special group , i have , after deliberation , taken up domestic pigeons . i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain , and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world , more especially by the hon . w . elliot from india , and by the hon . c . murray from persia . many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons , and some of them are very important , as being of considerable antiquity . i have associated with several eminent fanciers , and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs . the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing . compare the english carrier and the short - faced tumbler , and see the wonderful difference in their beaks , entailing corresponding differences in their skulls . the carrier , more especially the male bird , is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head ; and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids , very large external orifices to the nostrils , and a wide gape of mouth . the short - faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch ; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock , and tumbling in the air head over heels . the runt is a bird of great size , with long , massive beak and large feet ; some of the sub - breeds of runts have very long necks , others very long wings and tails , others singularly short tails . the barb is allied to the carrier , but , instead of a very long beak , has a very short and very broad one . the pouter has a much elongated body , wings , and legs ; and its enormously developed crop , which it glories in inflating , may well excite astonishment and even laughter . the turbit has a very short and conical beak , with a line of reversed feathers down the breast ; and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the œsophagus . the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood ; and it has , proportionally to its size , much elongated wing and tail feathers . the trumpeter and laugher , as their names express , utter a very different coo from the other breeds . the fantail has thirty or even forty tail - feathers , instead of twelve or fourteen — the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family ; and these feathers are kept expanded , and are carried so erect , that in good birds the head and tail touch : the oil - gland is quite aborted . several other less distinct breeds might be specified . in the skeletons of the several breeds , the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously . the shape , as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw , varies in a highly remarkable manner . the caudal and sacral vertebræ vary in number ; as does the number of the ribs , together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes . the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable ; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula . the proportional width of the gape of mouth , the proportional length of the eyelids , of the orifice of the nostrils , of the tongue ( not always in strict correlation with the length of beak ), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the œsophagus ; the development and abortion of the oil - gland ; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers ; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body ; the relative length of leg and of the feet ; the number of scutellæ on the toes , the development of skin between the toes , are all points of structure which are variable . the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies , as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched . the shape and size of the eggs vary . the manner of flight , and in some breeds the voice and disposition , differ remarkably . lastly , in certain breeds , the males and females have come to differ to a slight degree from each other . altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen , which , if shown to an ornithologist , and he were told that they were wild birds , would certainly be ranked by him as well - defined species . moreover , i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the english carrier , the short - faced tumbler , the runt , the barb , pouter , and fantail in the same genus ; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly - inherited sub - breeds , or species as he might have called them , could be shown him . great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons , i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct , namely , that all have descended from the rock - pigeon ( columba livia ), including under this term several geographical races or sub - species , which differ from each other in the most trifling respects . as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases , i will here briefly give them . if the several breeds are not varieties , and have not proceeded from the rock - pigeon , they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks ; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number : how , for instance , could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent - stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop ? the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock - pigeons , that is , not breeding or willingly perching on trees . but besides c . livia , with its geographical sub - species , only two or three other species of rock - pigeons are known ; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds . hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated , and yet be unknown to ornithologists ; and this , considering their size , habits , and remarkable characters , seems very improbable ; or they must have become extinct in the wild state . but birds breeding on precipices , and good fliers , are unlikely to be exterminated ; and the common rock - pigeon , which has the same habits with the domestic breeds , has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets , or on the shores of the mediterranean . hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock - pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption . moreover , the several above - named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world , and , therefore , some of them must have been carried back again into their native country ; but not one has ever become wild or feral , though the dovecot - pigeon , which is the rock - pigeon in a very slightly altered state , has become feral in several places . again , all recent experience shows that it is difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication ; yet , on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons , it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half - civilized man , as to be quite prolific under confinement . an argument , as it seems to me , of great weight , and applicable in several other cases , is , that the above specified breeds , though agreeing generally in constitution , habits , voice , colouring , and in most parts of their structure , with the wild rock - pigeon , yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure ; we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of columbidæ for a beak like that of the english carrier , or that of the short - faced tumbler , or barb ; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin ; for a crop like that of the pouter ; for tail - feathers like those of the fantail . hence it must be assumed not only that half - civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species , but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species ; and further , that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown . so many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree . some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration . the rock - pigeon is of a slaty - blue , and has a white croup ( the indian sub - species , c . intermedia of strickland , having it bluish ); the tail has a terminal dark bar , with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white ; the wings have two black bars : some semi - domestic breeds , and some apparently truly wild breeds , have , besides the two black bars , the wings chequered with black . these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family . now , in every one of the domestic breeds , taking thoroughly well - bred birds , all the above marks , even to the white edging of the outer tail - feathers , sometimes concur perfectly developed . moreover , when birds belonging to two or more distinct breeds are crossed , none of which are blue or have any of the above - specified marks , the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters . to give one instance out of several which i have observed : — i crossed some white fantails , which breed very true , with some black barbs — and it so happens that blue varieties of barbs are so rare that i never heard of an instance in england ; and the mongrels were black , brown , and mottled . i also crossed a barb with a spot , which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the forehead , and which notoriously breeds very true ; the mongrels were dusky and mottled . i then crossed one of the mongrel barb - fantails with a mongrel barb - spot , and they produced a bird</td><td style="border: 1px black solid; border-collapse: collapse;">of the \" crackers \" ( i . e . florida squatters ) added , \" we select the black members of a litter for raising , as they alone have a good chance of living .\" hairless dogs have imperfect teeth : long - haried and coarse - haired animals are apt to have , as is asserted , long or many horns ; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes ; pigeons with short beaks have small feet , and those with long beaks large feet . hence if man goes on selecting , and thus augmenting , any peculiarity , he will almost certainly unintentionally modify other parts of the structure , owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth . the result of the various , quite unknown , or dimly seen laws of variation is infinitely complex and diversified . it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated plants , as on the hyacinth , potato , even the dahlia , & c .; and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub - varieties differ slightly from each other . the whole organisation seems to have become plastic , and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type . any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us . but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure , both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance , are endless . dr . prosper lucas ' s treatise , in two large volumes , is the fullest and the best on this subject . no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance : like produces like is his fundamental belief : doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone . when any deviation of structure often appears , and we see it in the father and child , we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both ; but when amongst individuals , apparently exposed to the same conditions , any very rare deviation , due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances , appears in the parent — say , once amongst several million individuals — and it reappears in the child , the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance . every one must have heard of cases of albinism , prickly skin , hairy bodies , & c ., appearing in several members of the same family . if strange and rare deviations of structure are really inherited , less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable . perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject , would be , to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule , and non - inheritance as the anomaly . the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown ; no one can say why a peculiarity in different individuals of the same species , or in individuals of different species , is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so ; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grand - father or grandmother or other more remote ancestor ; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes , or to one sex alone , more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex . it is a fact of some little importance to us , that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted , either exclusively or in a much greater degree , to males alone . a much more important rule , which i think may be trusted , is that , at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears , it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age , though sometimes earlier . in many cases this could not be otherwise : thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature ; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage . but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension , and that , when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age , yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent . i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology . these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity , and not to its primary cause , which may have acted on the ovules or on the male element ; in nearly the same manner as in the offspring from a short - horned cow by a long - horned bull , the greater length of horn , though appearing late in life , is clearly due to the male element . having alluded to the subject of reversion , i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists — namely , that our domestic varieties , when run wild , gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks . hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature . i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made . there would be great difficulty in proving its truth : we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly - marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state . in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was , and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued . it would be quite necessary , in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing , that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home . nevertheless , as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms , it seems to me not improbable , that if we could succeed in naturalising , or were to cultivate , during many generations , the several races , for instance , of the cabbage , in very poor soil ( in which case , however , some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil ), that they would to a large extent , or even wholly , revert to the wild aboriginal stock . whether or not the experiment would succeed , is not of great importance for our line of argument ; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed . if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion , — that is , to lose their acquired characters , whilst kept under the same conditions , and whilst kept in a considerable body , so that free intercrossing might check , by blending together , any slight deviations in their structure , in such case , i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species . but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view : to assert that we could not breed our cart and race - horses , long and short - horned cattle , and poultry of various breeds , and esculent vegetables , for an almost infinite number of generations , would be opposed to all experience . i may add , that , when under nature the conditions of life do change , variations and reversions of character probably do occur ; but natural selection , as will hereafter be explained , will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved . character of domestic varieties ; difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and species ; origin of domestic varieties from one or more species . when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants , and compare them with closely allied species , we generally perceive in each domestic race , as already remarked , less uniformity of character than in true species . domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character ; by which i mean , that , although differing from each other , and from other species of the same genus , in several trifling respects , they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part , both when compared one with another , and more especially when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest allied . with these exceptions ( and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed , — a subject hereafter to be discussed ), domestic races of the same species differ from each other , only in most cases in a lesser degree , in the same manner as do closely - allied species of the same genus in a state of nature . i think that this must be admitted , when we find that there are hardly any domestic races , either amongst animals or plants , which have not been ranked by competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species , and by other competent judges as mere varieties . if any marked distinction existed between domestic races and species , this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur . it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value . i think it can be shown that this statement is hardly correct ; but naturalists differ widely in determining what characters are of generic value ; all such valuations being at present empirical . moreover , on the view of the origin of genera which i shall presently give , we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions . when we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species , we are soon involved in doubt , from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent - species . this point , if it could be cleared up , would be interesting ; if , for instance , it could be shown that the greyhound , bloodhound , terrier , spaniel , and bull - dog , which we all know propagate their kind so truly , were the offspring of any single species , then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied natural species — for instance , of the many foxes — inhabiting different quarters of the world . i do not believe , as we shall presently see , that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication ; i believe that some small part of the difference is due to their having descended from distinct species . in the case of some other domesticated species , there is presumptive , or even strong evidence , that all the breeds have descended from a single wild stock . it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary , and likewise to withstand diverse climates . i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions ; but how could a savage possibly know , when he first tamed an animal , whether it would vary in succeeding generations , and whether it would endure other climates ? has the little variability of the ass and goose , or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer , or of cold by the common camel , prevented their domestication ? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants , equal in number to our domesticated productions , and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries , were taken from a state of nature , and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication , they would on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied . in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants , it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion , whether they have descended from one or several wild species . the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is , that we find in the most ancient times , on the monuments of egypt , and in the lake - habitations of switzerland , much diversity in the breeds ; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble or are even identical with those still existing . but this only throws far backwards the history of civilization , and shows that animals were domesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed . the lake - inhabitants of switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat and barley , the pea , the poppy for oil , and flax ; and they possessed several domesticated animals ; they had also commerce with other nations . all this clearly shows , as heer has remarked , that they had at this early age progressed considerably in civilization ; and this again implies a long - continued previous period of less advanced civilization , during which the domesticated animals , kept by the different tribes and in different districts , might have varied and given rise to distinct races . since the discovery of flint tools or celts in the superficial formations of france and england , all geologists believe that man in a barbarous condition existed at an enormously remote period ; and we know that at the present day there is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the dog . the origin of most of our domestic animals will probably for ever remain vague . but i may here state , that , looking to the domestic dogs of the whole world , i have , after a laborious collection of all known facts , come to the conclusion that several wild species of canidæ have been tamed , and that their blood , more or less mingled together , flows in the veins of our many domestic breeds . in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion . from facts communicated to me by mr . blyth , on the habits , voice , constitution , and structure of the humped indian cattle , it is probable that these are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle ; and some competent judges believe that these latter have had several wild parents , — whether or not these deserve to be called species or races . this conclusion , as well as the specific distinction between the humped and common cattle , may indeed be looked at as almost established by the recent admirable researches of professor rütimeyer . with respect to horses , from reasons which i cannot here give , i am with much doubt inclined to believe , in opposition to several authors , that all the races have descended from one wild stock . mr . blyth , whose opinion , from his large and varied stores of knowledge , i should value more than that of almost any one , thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild indian fowl ( gallus bankiva ): having kept nearly all the english kinds alive , having bred and crossed them , and examined their skeletons , i have come to a similar conclusion , — the grounds of which will be given in a future work . in regard to ducks and rabbits , the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure , the evidence strongly preponderates in favour of their having all descended from the common wild duck and rabbit . the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks , has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors . they believe that every race which breeds true , let the distinctive characters be ever so slight , has had its wild prototype . at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle , as many sheep , and several goats in europe alone , and several even within great britain . one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it ! when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal , and france but few distinct from those of germany , and conversely , and so with hungary , spain , & c ., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle , sheep , & c ., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe ; for whence could they have been derived , as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent - stocks ? so it is in india . even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world , which i admit to have descended from several wild species , it cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation ; for who will believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound , the bloodhound , the bull - dog , pug - dog , or blenheim spaniel , & c . — so unlike all wild canidæ — ever existed freely in a state of nature ? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species ;

but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations , hardly two of them will be alike ; and then the extreme difficulty , or rather utter hopelessness of the task becomes apparent . certainly , a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and long - continued selection ; nor can i find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed . breeds of the domestic pigeon , their differences and origin . believing that it is always best to study some special group , i have , after deliberation , taken up domestic pigeons . i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain , and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world , more especially by the hon . w . elliot from india , and by the hon . c . murray from persia . many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons , and some of them are very important , as being of considerable antiquity . i have associated with several eminent fanciers , and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs . the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing . compare the english carrier and the short - faced tumbler , and see the wonderful difference in their beaks , entailing corresponding differences in their skulls . the carrier , more especially the male bird , is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head ;

and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock , and tumbling in the air head over heels . the runt is a bird of great size , with long , massive beak and large feet ; some of the sub - breeds of runts have very long necks , others very long wings and tails , others singularly short tails . the barb is allied to the carrier , but , instead of a very long beak , has a very short and very broad one . the pouter has a much elongated body , wings , and legs ;

the number of scutellæ on the toes , the development of skin between the toes , are all points of structure which are variable . the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies , as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched . the shape and size of the eggs vary . the manner of flight , and in some breeds the voice and disposition , differ re - markably . lastly , in certain breeds , the males and females have come to differ in a slight degree from each other . altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen , which , if shown to an ornithologist , and he were told that they were wild birds , would certainly be ranked by him as well - defined species . moreover , i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the english carrier , the short - faced tumbler , the runt , the barb , pouter , and fantail in the same genus ; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly - inherited sub - breeds , or species as he would have called them , could be shown him . great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons , i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct , namely , that all have descended from the rock - pigeon ( columba livia ), including under this term several geographical races or sub - species , which differ from each other in the most trifling respects . as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases , i will here briefly give them . if the several breeds are not varieties , and have not proceeded from the rock - pigeon , they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks ; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number : how , for instance , could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent - stocks possesse the characteristic enormous crop ? the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock - pigeons , that is , not breeding or willingly perching on trees . but besides c . livia , with its geographical sub - species , only two or three other species of rock - pigeons are known ; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds . hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated , and yet be unknown to ornithologists ; and this , considering their size , habits , and remarkable characters , seems very improbable ; or they must have become extinct in the wild state . but birds breeding on precipices , and good fliers , are unlikely to be exterminated ; and the common rock - pigeon , which has the same habits with the domestic breeds , has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets , or on the shores of the mediterranean . hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock - pigeon seems to be a very rash assumption . moreover , the several above - named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world , and , therefore , some of them must have been carried back again into their native country ; but not one has ever become wild or feral , though the dovecot - pigeon , which is the rock - pigeon in a very slightly altered state , has become feral in several places . again , all recent experience shows that it is difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication ; yet , on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons , it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half - civilized man , as to be quite prolific under confinement . an argument , as it seems to me , of great weight , and applicable in several other cases , is , that the above - specified breeds , though agreeing generally in constitution , habits , voice , colouring , and in most parts of their structure , with the wild rock - pigeon , yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure ; we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of columbidæ for a beak like that of the english carrier , or that of the short - faced tumbler , or barb ; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin ; for a crop like that of the pouter ; for tail - feathers like those of the fantail . hence it must be assumed not only that half - civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species , but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species ; and further , that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown . so many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree . some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration . the rock - pigeon is of a slaty - blue , and has a white croup ( the indian sub - species , c . intermedia of strickland , having it bluish ); the tail has a terminal dark bar , with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white ; the wings have two black bars : some semi - domestic breeds , and some apparently truly wild breeds , have , besides the two black bars , the wings chequered with black . these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family . now , in every one of the domestic breeds , taking thoroughly well - bred birds , all the above marks , even to the white edging of the outer tail - feathers , sometimes concur perfectly developed . moreover , when birds belonging to two or more distinct breeds are crossed , none of which are blue or have any of the above - specified marks , the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters . to give one instance out of several which i have observed : — i crossed some white fantails , which breed very true , with some black barbs — and it so happens that blue varieties of barbs are so rare that i never heard of an instance in england ; and the mongrels were black , brown , and mottled . i also crossed a barb with a spot , which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the forehead , and which notoriously breeds very true ; the mongrels were dusky and mottled . i then crossed one of the mongrel barb - fantails with a mongrel barb - spot , and they produced a bird</td><td style="border: 1px black solid;

pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes ; pigeons with short beaks have small feet , and those with long beaks large feet . hence if man goes on selecting , and thus augmenting , any peculiarity , he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure , owing to the mysterious laws of correlation . the results of the various , unknown , or but dimly understood laws of variation are infinitely complex and diversified . it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated plants , as on the hyacinth , potato , even the dahlia , & c .; and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub - varieties differ slightly from each other . the whole organisation seems to have become plastic , and tends to depart in a slight degree from that of the parental type . any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us . but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure , both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance , are endless . dr . prosper lucas ' s treatise , in two large volumes , is the fullest and the best on this subject . no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance : that like produces like is his fundamental belief : doubts have been thrown on this principle only by theoretical writers . when any deviation of structure often appears , and we see it in the father and child , we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both ; but when amongst individuals , apparently exposed to the same conditions , any very rare deviation , due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances , appears in the parent — say , once amongst several million individuals — and it reappears in the child , the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance . every one must have heard of cases of albinism , prickly skin , hairy bodies , & c ., appearing in several members of the same family . if strange and rare deviations of structure are really inherited , less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable . perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject , would be , to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule , and non - inheritance as the anomaly . the laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown . no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species , or in different species , is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so ; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor ; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes , or to one sex alone , more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex . it is a fact of some importance to us , that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted , either exclusively or in a much greater degree , to the males alone . a much more important rule , which i think may be trusted , is that , at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears , it tends to re - appear in the offspring at a corresponding age , though sometimes earlier . in many cases this could not be otherwise : thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature ; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage . but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension , and that , when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age , yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent . i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology . these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity , and not to its primary cause , which may have acted on the ovules or on the male element ; in nearly the same manner as in the offspring from a short - horned cow by a long - horned bull , the greater length of horn , though appearing late in life , is clearly due to the male element . having alluded to the subject of reversion , i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists — namely , that our domestic varieties , when run wild , gradually but invariably revert in character to their aboriginal stocks . hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature . i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made . there would be great difficulty in proving its truth : we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly - marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state . in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was , and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued . it would be necessary , in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing , that only a single variety should have been turned loose in its new home . nevertheless , as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms , it seems to me not improbable , that if we could succeed in naturalising , or were to cultivate , during many generations , the several races , for instance , of the cabbage , in very poor soil ( in which case , however , some effect would have to be attributed to the definite action of the poor soil ), that they would to a large extent , or even wholly , revert to the wild aboriginal stock . whether or not the experiment would succeed , is not of great importance for our line of argument ; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed . if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion , — that is , to lose their acquired characters , whilst kept under the same conditions , and whilst kept in a considerable body , so that free intercrossing might check , by blending together , any slight deviations in their structure , in such case , i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species . but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view : to assert that we could not breed our cart and race - horses , long and short - horned cattle , and poultry of various breeds , and esculent vegetables , for an unlimited number of generations , would be opposed to all experience . character of domestic varieties ; difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and species ; origin of domestic varieties from one or more species . when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants , and compare them with closely allied species , we generally perceive in each domestic race , as already remarked , less uniformity of character than in true species . domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character ; by which i mean , that , although differing from each other , and from other species of the same genus , in several trifling respects , they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part , both when compared one with another , and more especially when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest allied . with these exceptions ( and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed , — a subject hereafter to be discussed ), domestic races of the same species differ from each other , only in most cases in a less degree , in the same manner as do closely - allied species of the same genus in a state of nature . this must be admitted as true , for the domestic races of many animals and plants have been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species , and by other competent judges as mere varieties . if any well marked distinction existed between a domestic race and a species , this source of doubt would not so perpetually recur . it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value . it can be shown that this statement is not correct ; but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are of generic value ; all such valua - tions being at present empirical . when it is explained how genera originate under nature , it will be seen that we have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference in our domesticated races . in attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species , we are soon involved in doubt , from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent - species . this point , if it could be cleared up , would be interesting ; if , for instance , it could be shown that the greyhound , bloodhound , terrier , spaniel , and bull - dog , which we all know propagate their kind so truly , were the offspring of any single species , then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied natural species — for instance , of the many foxes — inhabiting different quarters of the world . i do not believe , as we shall presently see , that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication ; i believe that some small part of the difference is due to their having descended from distinct species . in the case of strongly marked races in some other domesticated species , there is presumptive , or even strong evidence , that all are descended from a single wild stock . it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary , and likewise to withstand diverse climates . i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions ; but how could a savage possibly know , when he first tamed an animal , whether it would vary in succeeding generations , and whether it would endure other climates ? has the little variability of the ass and goose , or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer , or of cold by the common camel , prevented their domestication ? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants , equal in number to our domesticated productions , and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries , were taken from a state of nature , and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication , they would on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied . in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants , it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion , whether they are descended from one or several wild species . the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is , that we find in the most ancient times , on the monuments of egypt , and in the lake - habitations of switzerland , much diversity in the breeds ; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble or are even identical with those still existing . but this only throws far backwards the history of civilization , and shows that animals were domesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed . the lake - inhabitants of switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat and barley , the pea , the poppy for oil , and flax ; and they possessed several domesticated animals ; they had also commerce with other nations . all this clearly shows , as heer has remarked , that they had at this early age progressed considerably in civilization ; and this again implies a long - continued previous period of less advanced civilization , during which the domesticated animals , kept by the different tribes in different districts , might have varied and given rise to distinct races . since the discovery of flint tools or celts in the superficial formations in many parts of the world , all geologists believe that barbarian man existed at an enormously remote period ; and we know that at the present day there is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the dog . the origin of most of our domestic animals will probably for ever remain vague . but i may here state , that , looking to the domestic dogs of the whole world , i have , after a laborious collection of all known facts , come to the conclusion that several wild species of canidæ have been tamed , and that their blood , in some cases mingled together , flows in the veins of our domestic breeds . in regard to sheep and goats i can form no decided opinion . from facts communicated to me by mr . blyth , on the habits , voice , constitution , and structure of the humped indian cattle , it is almost certain that they are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle ; and some competent judges believe that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors , — whether or not these deserve to be called species or races . this conclusion , as well as the specific distinction between the humped and common cattle , may , indeed , be looked at as established by the recent admirable researches of professor rütimeyer . with respect to horses , from reasons which i cannot here give , i am doubtfully inclined to believe , in opposition to several authors , that all the races belong to the same species . having kept nearly all the english breeds of the fowl alive , having bred and crossed them , and examined their skeletons , it appears to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild indian fowl , gallus bankiva ; and this is the conclusion of mr . blyth , and of others who have studied this bird in india . in regard to ducks and rabbits , some breeds of which differ much from each other , the evidence is clear that they are all descended from the common wild duck and rabbit . the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks , has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors . they believe that every race which breeds true , let the distinctive characters be ever so slight , has had its wild prototype . at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle , as many sheep , and several goats , in europe alone , and several even within great britain . one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it ! when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal , and france but few distinct from those of germany , and conversely , and so with hungary , spain , & c ., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle , sheep , & c ., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe ; for whence have they been derived , as these several countries could not possess so large a number of peculiar species for parent - stocks ? so it is in india . even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world , which i admit to have descended from several wild species , it cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation ; for who will believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound , the bloodhound , the bull - dog , pug - dog , or blenheim spaniel , & c . — so unlike all wild canidæ — ever existed freely in a state of nature ? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species ; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents ; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process , we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms , as the italian greyhound , bloodhound , bull - dog , & c ., in the wild state . moreover , the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated . many cases are on record , showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses , if aided by the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired character ; but to obtain a race nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species , would be very difficult . sir j . sebright expressly experimented for this object , and failed . the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes ( as i have found with pigeons ) extremely uniform , and everything seems simple enough ; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations , hardly two of them are alike ; and then the extreme difficulty of the task becomes apparent . certainly , a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and long - continued selection ; nor can i find a case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed . breeds of the domestic pigeon , their differences and origin . believing that it is always best to study some special group , i have , after deliberation , taken up domestic pigeons . i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain , and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world , more especially by the hon . w . elliot from india , and by the hon . c . murray from persia . many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons , and some of them are very important , as being of considerable antiquity . i have associated with several eminent fanciers , and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs . the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing . compare the english carrier and the short - faced tumbler , and see the wonderful dif - ference in their beaks , entailing corresponding differences in their skulls . the carrier , more especially the male bird , is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head ; and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids , very large external orifices to the nostrils , and a wide gape of mouth . the short - faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch ; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock , and tumbling in the air head over heels . the runt is a bird of great size , with long massive beak and large feet ; some of the sub - breeds of runts have very long necks , others very long wings and tails , others singularly short tails . the barb is allied to the carrier , but , instead of a long beak , has a very short and broad one . the pouter has a much elongated body , wings , and legs ; and its enormously developed crop , which it glories in inflating , may well excite astonishment and even laughter . the turbit has a very short and conical beak , with a line of reversed feathers down the breast ; and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the œsophagus . the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood ; and it has , proportionally to its size , much elongated wing and tail feathers . the trumpeter and laugher , as their names express , utter a very different coo from the other breeds . the fantail has thirty or even forty tail - feathers , instead of twelve or fourteen — the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family ; and these feathers are kept expanded , and are carried so erect , that in good birds the head and tail touch : the oil - gland is quite aborted . several other less distinct breeds might be specified . in the skeletons of the several breeds , the develop - ment of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously . the shape , as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw , varies in a highly remarkable manner . the caudal and sacral vertebræ vary in number ; as does the number of the ribs , together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes . the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable ; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula . the proportional width of the gape of mouth , the proportional length of the eyelids , of the orifice of the nostrils , of the tongue ( not always in strict correlation with the length of beak ), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the œsophagus ; the development and abortion of the oil - gland ; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers ; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body ; the relative length of leg and of the feet ; the number of scutellæ on the toes , the development of skin between the toes , are all points of structure which are variable . the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies , as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched . the shape and size of the eggs vary . the manner of flight , and in some breeds the voice and disposition , differ remarkably . lastly , in certain breeds , the males and females have come to differ in a slight degree from each other . altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen , which , if shown to an ornithologist , and he were told that they were wild birds , would certainly be ranked by him as well - defined species . moreover , i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the english carrier , the short - faced tumbler , the runt , the barb , pouter , and fantail in the same genus ; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly - inherited sub - breeds , or species as he would have called them , could be shown him . great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons , i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct , namely , that all are descended from the rock - pigeon ( columba livia ), including under this term several geographical races or sub - species , which differ from each other in the most trifling respects . as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases , i will here briefly give them . if the several breeds are not varieties , and have not proceeded from the rock - pigeon , they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks ;

for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed . if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion , — that is , to lose their acquired characters , whilst kept under the same conditions , and whilst kept in a considerable body , so that free intercrossing might check , by blending together , any slight deviations in their structure , in such case , i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species . but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view : to assert that we could not breed our cart and race - horses , long and short - horned cattle , and poultry of various breeds , and esculent vegetables , for an unlimited number of generations , would be opposed to all experience . character of domestic varieties : difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and species ; origin of domestic varieties from one or more species . when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants , and compare them with closely allied species , we generally perceive in each domestic race , as already remarked , less uniformity of character than in true species . domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character ; by which i mean , that , although differing from each other , and from other species of the same genus , in several trifling respects , they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part , both when compared one with another , and more especially when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest allied . with these exceptions ( and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed , — a subject hereafter to be discussed ), domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as do the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature , but the differences in most cases are less in degree . this must be admitted as true , for the domestic races of many animals and plants have been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species , and by other competent judges as mere varieties . if any well marked distinction existed between a domestic race and a species , this source of doubt would not so perpetually recur . it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value . it can be shown that this statement is not correct ; but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are of generic value ; all such valuations being at present empirical . when it is explained how genera originate under nature , it will be seen that we have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference in our domesticated races . in attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between allied domestic races , we are soon involved in doubt , from not knowing whether they are descended from one or several parent species . this point , if it could be cleared up , would be interesting ; if , for instance , it could be shown that the greyhound , bloodhound , terrier , spaniel , and bull - dog , which we all know propagate their kind truly , were the offspring of any single species , then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many closely allied natural species — for instance , of the many foxes — inhabiting different quarters of the world . i do not believe , as we shall presently see , that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication ; i believe that a small part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species . in the case of strongly marked races of some other domesticated species , there is presumptive or even strong evidence , that all are descended from a single wild stock . it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary , and likewise to withstand diverse climates . i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions ; but how could a savage possibly know , when he first tamed an animal , whether it would vary in succeeding generations , and whether it would endure other climates ? has the little variability of the ass and goose , or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer , or of cold by the common camel , prevented their domestication ? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants , equal in number to our domesticated productions , and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries , were taken from a state of nature , and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication , they would on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied . in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants , it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion , whether they are descended from one or several wild species . the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is , that we find in the most ancient times , on the monuments of egypt , and in the lake - habitations of switzerland , much diversity in the breeds ; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble , or are even identical with , those still existing . but this only throws far backwards the history of civilisation , and shows that animals were domesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed . the lake - inhabitants of switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat and barley , the pea , the poppy for oil , and flax ; and they possessed several domesticated animals . they also carried on commerce with other nations . all this clearly shows , as heer has remarked , that they had at this early age progressed considerably in civilisation ; and this again implies a long continued previous period of less advanced civilisation , during which the domesticated animals , kept by different tribes in different districts , might have varied and given rise to distinct races . since the discovery of flint tools in the superficial formations of many parts of the world , all geologists believe that barbarian man existed at an enormously remote period ; and we know that at the present day there is hardly a tribe so barbarous , as not to have domesticated at least the dog . the origin of most of our domestic animals will probably for ever remain vague . but i may here state , that , looking to the domestic dogs of the whole world , i have , after a laborious collection of all known facts , come to the conclusion that several wild species of canidæ have been tamed , and that their blood , in some cases mingled together , flows in the veins of our domestic breeds . in regard to sheep and goats i can form no decided opinion . from facts communicated to me by mr . blyth , on the habits , voice , constitution , and structure of the humped indian cattle , it is almost certain that they are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle ; and some competent judges believe that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors , — whether or not these deserve to be called species . this conclusion , as well as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common cattle , may , indeed , be looked upon as established by the admirable researches of professor rütimeyer . with respect to horses , from reasons which i cannot here give , i am doubtfully inclined to believe , in opposition to several authors , that all the races belong to the same species . having kept nearly all the english breeds of the fowl alive , having bred and crossed them , and examined their skeletons , it appears to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild indian fowl , gallus bankiva ; and this is the conclusion of mr . blyth , and of others who have studied this bird in india . in regard to ducks and rabbits , some breeds of which differ much from each other , the evidence is clear that they are all descended from the common wild duck and rabbit . the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks , has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors . they believe that every race which breeds true , let the distinctive characters be ever so slight , has had its wild prototype . at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle , as many sheep , and several goats , in europe alone , and several even within great britain . one author believes that there formerly existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to great britain ! when we bear in mind that britain has now not one peculiar mammal , and france but few distinct from those of germany , and so with hungary , spain , & c ., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle , sheep , & c ., we must admit that many domestic breeds must have originated in europe ; for whence otherwise could they have been derived ? so it is in india . even in the case of the breeds of the domestic dog throughout the world , which i admit are descended from several wild species , it cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation ; for who will believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound , the bloodhound , the bull - dog , pug - dog , or blenheim spaniel , & c . — so unlike all wild canidæ — ever existed in a state of nature ? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species ; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents ; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process , we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms , as the italian greyhound , bloodhound , bull - dog , & c ., in the wild state . moreover , the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated . many cases are on record , showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses , if aided by the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired character ; but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct races , would be very difficult . sir j . sebright expressly experimented with this object , and failed . the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes ( as i have found with pigeons ) quite uniform in character , and everything seems simple enough ; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations , hardly two of them are alike , and then the difficulty of the task becomes manifest . breeds of the domestic pigeon , their differences and origin . believing that it is always best to study some special group , i have , after deliberation , taken up domestic pigeons . i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain , and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world , more especially by the hon . w . elliott from india , and by the hon . c . murray from persia . many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons , and some of them are very important , as being of considerable antiquity . i have associated with several eminent fanciers , and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs . the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing . compare the english carrier and the short - faced tumbler , and see the wonderful difference in their beaks , entailing corresponding differences in their skulls . the carrier , more especially the male bird , is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head ; and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids , very large external orifices to the nostrils , and a wide gape of mouth . the short - faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch ; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock , and tumbling in the air head over heels . the runt is a bird of great size , with long massive beak and large feet ; some of the sub - breeds of runts have very long necks , others very long wings and tails , others singularly short tails . the barb is allied to the carrier , but , instead of a long beak , has a very short and broad one . the pouter has a much elongated body , wings , and legs ; and its enormously developed crop , which it glories in inflating , may well excite astonishment and even laughter . the turbit has a short and conical beak , with a line of reversed feathers down the breast ; and it has the habit of continually expanding , slightly , the upper part of the œsophagus . the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood ; and it has , proportionally to its size , elongated wing and tail feathers . the trumpeter and laugher , as their names express , utter a very different coo from the other breeds . the fantail has thirty or even forty tail - feathers , instead of twelve or fourteen — the normal number in all the members of the great pigeon family : these feathers are kept expanded , and are carried so erect , that in good birds the head and tail touch : the oil - gland is quite aborted . several other less distinct breeds might be specified . in the skeletons of the several breeds , the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously . the shape , as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw , varies in a highly remarkable manner . the caudal and sacral vertebræ vary in number ; as does the number of the ribs , together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes . the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable ; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula . the proportional width of the gape of mouth , the proportional length of the eyelids , of the orifice of the nostrils , of the tongue ( not always in strict correlation with the length of beak ), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the œsophagus ; the development and abortion of the oil - gland ; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers ; the relative length of the wing and tail to each other and to the body ; the relative length of the leg and foot ; the number of scutellæ on the toes , the development of skin between the toes , are all points of structure which are variable . the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies , as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched . the shape and size of the eggs vary . the manner of flight , and in some breeds the voice and disposition , differ remarkably . lastly , in certain breeds , the males and females have come to differ in a slight degree from each other . altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen , which , if shown to an ornithologist , and he were told that they were wild birds , would certainly be ranked by him as well - defined species . moreover , i do not believe that any ornithologist would in this case place the english carrier , the short - faced tumbler , the runt , the barb , pouter , and fantail in the same genus ; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly - inherited sub - breeds , or species , as he would call them , could be shown him . great as are the differences between the breeds of the pigeon , i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct , namely , that all are descended from the rock pigeon ( columba livia ), including under this term several geographical races or sub - species , which differ from each other in the most trifling respects . as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases , i will here briefly give them . if the several breeds are not varieties , and have not proceeded from the rock - pigeon , they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks ; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number : how , for instance , could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent - stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop ? the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock - pigeons , that is , they did not breed or willingly perch on trees . but besides c . livia , with its geographical sub - species , only two or three other species of rock - pigeons are known ; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds . hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated , and yet be unknown to ornithologists ; and this , considering their size , habits , and remarkable characters , seems improbable ; or they must have become extinct in the wild state . but birds breeding on precipices , and good fliers , are unlikely to be exterminated ; and the common rock - pigeon , which has the same habits with the domestic breeds , has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets , or on the shores of the mediterranean . hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock - pigeon seems a very rash assumption . moreover , the several above - named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world , and , therefore , some of them must have been carried back again into their native country ; but not one has become wild or feral , though the dovecot - pigeon , which is the rock - pigeon in a very slightly altered state , has become feral in several places . again , all recent experience shows that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed freely under domestication ; yet , on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons , it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half - civilised man , as to be quite prolific under confinement . an argument of great weight , and applicable in several other cases , is , that the above - specified breeds , though agreeing generally with the wild rock - pigeon in constitution , habits , voice , colouring , and in most parts of their structure , yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts ; we may look in vain through the whole great family of columbidæ for a beak like that of the english carrier , or that of the short - faced tumbler , or barb ; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin ; for a crop like that of the pouter ; for tail - feathers like those of the fantail . hence it must be assumed not only that half - civilised man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species , but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species ; and further , that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown . so many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree . some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration . the rock pigeon is of a slaty - blue , with white loins ; but the indian sub - species , c . intermedia of strickland , has this part bluish . the tail has a terminal dark bar , with the outer feathers externally edged at the base with white . the wings have two black bars . some semi - domestic breeds , and some truly wild breeds , have , besides the two black bars , the wings chequered with black . these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family . now , in every one of the domestic breeds , taking thoroughly well - bred birds , all the above marks , even to the white edging of the outer tail - feathers , sometimes concur perfectly developed . moreover , when birds belonging to two or more distinct breeds are crossed , none of which are blue or have any of the above - specified marks , the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters . to give one instance out of several which i have observed : — i crossed some white fantails , which breed very true , with some black barbs — and it so happens that blue varieties of barbs are so rare that i never heard of an instance in england ; and the mongrels were black , brown , and mottled . i also crossed a barb with a spot , which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the forehead , and which notoriously breeds very true ; the mongrels were dusky and mottled . i then crossed one of the mongrel barb - fantails with a mongrel barb - spot , and they produced a bird</td></tr><tr style="background-color: beige;

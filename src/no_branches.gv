. in rude and barbarous periods of english history choice animals were often imported , and laws were passed to prevent their exportation : the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered , and this may be compared to the \" roguing \" of plants by nurserymen . the principle of selection i find distinctly given in an ancient chinese encyclopædia . explicit rules are laid down by some of the roman classical writers . from passages in genesis , it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to . savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals , to improve the breed , and they formerly did so , as is attested by passages in pliny . the savages in south africa match their draught cattle by colour , as do some of the esquimaux their teams of dogs . livingstone"]

that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of mr . bakewell ' s flock , and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties .\" if there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals , yet any one animal particularly useful to them , for any special purpose , would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents , to which savages are so liable , and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones ; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on . we see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of tierra del fuego , by their killing and devouring their old women , in times of dearth , as of less value than their dogs . in plants the same gradual process of improvement , through the occasional preservation of the best individuals , whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties , and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing , may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease , rose , pelargonium , dahlia , and other plants , when compared with the older varieties or with their parent - stocks . no one would ever expect to get a first - rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant . no one would expect to raise a first - rate melting pear from the seed of the wild pear , though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild , if it had come from a garden - stock . the pear , though cultivated in classical times , appears , from"]

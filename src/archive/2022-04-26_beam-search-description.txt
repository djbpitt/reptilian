Beam search description
=======================

Assumptions:

1) All tokens appear exactly once in all witnesses
2) Assume invisible START and END nodes shared by all witnesses

===

Witness 0: the/0 red/1 and/2 some/3 black/4 cats/5
Witness 1: the/0 black/1 and/2 some/3 red/4 cats/5

@Root
[[the], 0] (* we have excluded repetition)

TIER 1 (1 option)

@[[the], 0]
[[the, red], 6]
[[the, black], 6]
[[the, SKIP], 4]

TIER 2 (3 options)

@[[the, red], 6]
[[the, red, cat], 10]

@[[the, black], 6]
[[the, black, cat], 10]

@[[the, SKIP], 4]
[[the, SKIP, and], 6]

TIER 3 (3 options)

@[[the, red, cats], 10]
DONE

@[[the, black, cats], 10]
DONE

@[[the, SKIP, and], 6]
[[the, SKIP, and, some], 8]

TIER 4 (3 options)

@[[the, red, cats], 10]
DONE (aligned 3 tokens)

@[[the, black, cats], 10]
DONE (aligned 3 tokens)

@[[the, SKIP, and, some, cats], 10]
DONE (aligned 4 tokens)

===

Assessment:

1) Weights at each step are number of tokens no longer available (already aligned or skipped). 
2) Favor Î² lowest weights.
3) All weights will be same at the end of all branches.
4) Favor largest number of aligned tokens at end.

In case of ties? Options:

1) Prefer longer gaps over more gaps (affine)
2) Prefer alignment with larger number of shared tokens in corresponding gaps
3) Choose one arbitrarily

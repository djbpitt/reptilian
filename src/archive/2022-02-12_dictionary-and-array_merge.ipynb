No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification. It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability, whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception. Geoffroy St. Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception. Several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the (2)</text>\n</g>\n<!-- 10 -->\n<g id=\"node11\" class=\"node\">\n<title>10</title>\n<ellipse fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" cx=\"22000.76\" cy=\"-94\" rx=\"70.39\" ry=\"18\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"22000.76\" y=\"-90.3\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">function (10)</text>\n</g>\n<!-- 2&#45;&gt;10 -->\n<g id=\"edge4\" class=\"edge\">\n<title>2-&gt;10</title>\n<path fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" d=\"M19653.51,-81.81C20673.64,-87.11 21641.5,-92.14 21920,-93.59\"/>\n<polygon fill=\"black\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"21920.38,-97.09 21930.4,-93.64 21920.42,-90.09 21920.38,-97.09\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"21870.86\" y=\"-96.8\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">w1,w2,w3</text>\n</g>\n<!-- 34 -->\n<g id=\"node35\" class=\"node\">\n<title>34</title>\n<ellipse fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" cx=\"22000.76\" cy=\"-40\" rx=\"75.29\" ry=\"18\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"22000.76\" y=\"-36.3\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">functions (34)</text>\n</g>\n<!-- 2&#45;&gt;34 -->\n<g id=\"edge3\" class=\"edge\">\n<title>2-&gt;34</title>\n<path fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" d=\"M19653.51,-52.19C20667.72,-46.92 21630.27,-41.92 21915.08,-40.44\"/>\n<polygon fill=\"black\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"21915.35,-43.94 21925.33,-40.39 21915.31,-36.94 21915.35,-43.94\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"21870.86\" y=\"-43.8\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">w0</text>\n</g>\n<!-- 3 -->\n<g id=\"node4\" class=\"node\">\n<title>3</title>\n<ellipse fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" cx=\"38160.69\" cy=\"-45\" rx=\"3539.67\" ry=\"18\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"38160.69\" y=\"-41.3\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">carnivorous birds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs.

      "when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues to vary for many generations. No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification. It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability, whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception. Geoffroy St. Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception. Several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the~w0:178|w1:177|w2:177|w3:180\n",

When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature, perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy(of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not quite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their~w0:559|w1:557|w2:561|w3:564\n",

      "Habit also has a decided influence, as in the period of flowering with plants when transported from one climate to another. In animals it has a more marked effect; for instance, I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild-duck; and I presume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild parent.
